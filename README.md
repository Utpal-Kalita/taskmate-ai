# TaskMate AI - CS50x Final Project

## Video Demo: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwCyWLeogY)

## Description

TaskMate AI is a comprehensive task management web application that combines traditional productivity features with artificial intelligence to help users break down complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Built with Flask and integrated with Google's Gemini AI, this application provides an intelligent approach to personal task management.

The application was developed as my final project for Harvard's CS50x course, demonstrating the integration of web development technologies, database management, user authentication, and AI services in a practical, real-world application.

### What TaskMate AI Does

TaskMate AI serves as a personal productivity assistant that goes beyond simple to-do lists. Users can create, organize, and manage their tasks while leveraging AI capabilities to automatically break down complex projects into smaller, actionable steps. The application features a clean, intuitive interface built with Bootstrap and custom CSS, providing users with visual feedback on their productivity through comprehensive dashboard analytics.

### Why This Project

I chose to build TaskMate AI because I wanted to explore how artificial intelligence could enhance traditional productivity tools. Many task management applications exist, but few integrate AI in a meaningful way to help users tackle overwhelming projects. This project allowed me to combine my learning from CS50x with modern AI technologies while creating something genuinely useful for personal productivity.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Flask 3.1.1**: Python web framework for application structure
- **CS50 SQL**: Database abstraction layer for SQLite operations
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for data persistence
- **Werkzeug**: Security utilities for password hashing
- **Google Generative AI**: Gemini model integration for task breakdown

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Semantic markup and modern styling
- **Bootstrap 5.3.3**: Responsive framework for UI components
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for enhanced visual elements
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for dynamic content rendering
- **Custom CSS**: Enhanced styling for improved user experience

### Development Tools
- **Python Virtual Environment**: Isolated dependency management
- **Git**: Version control for project history
- **Requirements.txt**: Dependency specification for easy deployment

## 🤖 Use of AI in This Project

- GitHub Copilot was used to assist with writing most of the css classes and Bootstrap layout for this project. This includes the landing page and layout components.

- An AI-based task breakdown feature was also implemented using the Gemini API. When a user enters a task, the application generates suggested subtasks by sending a natural language prompt to Gemini. These suggestions are reviewed and integrated into the task management flow.

- All AI-assisted code and features were reviewed, understood, and customized to fit the needs of the project.

## Design Decisions

### Database Schema
I chose SQLite for its simplicity and portability, perfect for a single-user application. The schema uses two main tables:
- **Users**: Stores authentication data with secure password hashing
- **Tasks**: Contains all task information with foreign key relationships

### AI Integration
The Google Gemini integration was chosen for its:
- Natural language processing capabilities
- Free tier availability for development
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Rate limiting that encourages thoughtful usage

### Frontend Architecture
Bootstrap was selected for rapid development while custom CSS provides:
- Consistent branding and visual identity
- Enhanced user experience beyond default Bootstrap components
- Responsive design patterns for mobile compatibility
- Accessibility considerations for diverse users

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing using Werkzeug's security utilities
- Session management through Flask's built-in session handling
- Input validation and sanitization on all forms
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration data



## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Collaborative Tasks**: Multi-user task sharing and assignment
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with Google Calendar or Outlook
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for iOS and Android
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed productivity reports and trends
- **Notification System**: Email and push notifications for deadlines

### Technical Improvements
- **Database Migration**: Move to PostgreSQL for production deployment
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for improved performance
- **API Development**: RESTful API for third-party integrations
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for cloud deployment
